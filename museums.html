                <h3>Nong Khai City Hall Museum</h3>
                <p>Nong Khai Provincial Museum was originally the first city hall of Nong Khai Province and the first building of Lao Phuan Province, built in 1897 as the Nong Khai provincial government office. The Nong Khai provincial government hall was the first building of the northern provinces (Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan, Loei, Nong Bua Lamphu, Sakon Nakhon). It was built of single-storey brick and mortar in a French-Vietnamese colonial style. The front porch protrudes from the front of the building. The windows are arched and supported by cornices. It was designed and built by Phra Wichit Khun San (Ui Nakornthap), who was the civil servant of Lao Phuan Province and the district chief of Mi Chai (Mueang Nong Khai District).</p>
                <p>It was divided into the office of Phraya Pathum Thewaphiban (Suea Na Nong Khai), the governor of Nong Khai (province) and Mi Chai District. In 2001, a budget was received to renovate and repair it to be used as the Nong Khai Provincial Cultural Hall until 2006 when the Nong Khai Provincial Cultural Council established it as the Nong Khai Provincial Museum, which is a permanent exhibition. The focus is on the history of Nong Khai Province, divided into 7 exhibition rooms: Room 1: Identity of Nong Khai; Room 2: Important People; Room 3: Archaeology; Room 4: Prehistoric Archaeology of Ban Khok Kon; Room 5: Cultural Diversity of Nong Khai; Room 6: Lifestyle of Nong Khai People; Room 7: Royal Grace towards Nong Khai City.</p>
